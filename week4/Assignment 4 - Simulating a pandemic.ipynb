You can think of it this way: The 0.1 kind of symbolizes 10% which means that we should approximately get that 10% of the population is sick. We randomize a number to get a varying amount of initiallty sick individuals so sometimes it might be that 11% of the population is sick, sometimes 9%. This is to add versatility to our simulation and make it more randomized. You will see this approach being replicated a lot in this assignment </li>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>As it happends, the particular virus we are dealing with has 5% chance of spreading if a sick individual gets in contact with a person that is susceptible (Kind of corresponds to that if you meet 20 people, one will get infected on average). A susceptible person is someone that is not dead, is not already sick  has not recovered from the virus, which we say would make you immune. On average each person in the village meets 10 people a day. </p>\n",

    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Create a method infect_others with the parameters self and population. In the method create a variable person_encounters which should sample as many as self.average_meetups people from the population. To sample indexes from the population array you can use random.sample (Google it!). I recommend that you sample indexes and not the people themselves, a way of doing this is something like this: random.sample(range(size of population), how many you want). </li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Having used random.sample your person_encounters list should now be a list of 10 indexes of people from the population array. Write a forloop over person_encounters with a loop variable person_id where in each loop you generate a probability like we do in day_passes and then check if the generated probability is less than or equal to self.infect_prob, also since this represents the way of infecting another individual include in the if-statement a check for whether the person is not dead nor has already recovered from the virus (Note: since we are looping over indexes to check the status of an individual you need to do something like population[person_id] to get the specific person). In total your if-statement should thus include 3 criteria at the moment; that the prob variable is less than self.infect_prob, that the person about to be potentially infected is not dead and has not previously recovered from the virus. </li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">if all of these conditions are met set the persons condition to sick. if done correctly it should look something like this population[person_id].sick = True. Where person_id is the loop variable. </li> \n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Lastly we need to add a call to this function from day_passes. At the beginning of the day_passes method first write an if statements that checks if the person we are currently working on is sick (currently working on refers to self). Then, inside of that if statement nest another if statement which checks if self.init_scenario == False (we do not want spread to happen on day 0). If the criteria are met call the infect_others method inside the second if statement </li>\n",
